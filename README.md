Kotlin multiplatform implementation of Reactive Extensions.

Should you have any questions or feedback welcome to the **Kotlin Slack channel**: 
[#reaktive](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/CU05HB31A)

### Setup
Recommended minimum Gradle version is 5.3. Please read first the documentation about
[metadata publishing mode](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html#experimental-metadata-publishing-mode).

Reaktive is published to Bintray, the repository is synchronized with JCenter.
Make sure you have the JCenter repository specified in your build.gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```

There are a number of modules published:
- `reaktive` - the main Reaktive library (multiplatform)
- `reaktive-annotations` - collection of annotations (mutiplatform)
- `reaktive-testing` - testing utilities (multiplatform)
- `utils` - some utilities like `Clock`, `AtomicReference`, `Lock`, etc. (multiplatform)
- `coroutines-interop` - Kotlin coroutines interoperability helpers (multiplatform)
- `rxjava2-interop` - RxJava2 interoperability helpers (JVM and Android)
- `rxjava3-interop` - RxJava3 interoperability helpers (JVM and Android)

### Features:
* Multiplatform: JVM, Android, iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, JavaScript, Linux X64, Linux ARM 32 hfp
* Schedulers support: 
  * `computationScheduler` - fixed thread pool equal to a number of cores
  * `ioScheduler` - unbound thread pool with caching policy
  * `newThreadScheduler` - creates a new thread for each unit of work
  * `singleScheduler` - executes tasks on a single shared background thread
  * `trampolineScheduler` - queues tasks and executes them on one of the participating threads
  * `mainScheduler` - executes tasks on main thread
* True multithreading for Kotlin/Native (there are some [limitations](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native/concurrency.html#object-transfer-and-freezing))
* Thread local subscriptions without freezing for Kotlin/Native
* Supported sources: `Observable`, `Maybe`, `Single`, `Completable`
* Subjects: `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, `UnicastSubject`
* Interoperability with Kotlin Coroutines: conversions between coroutines (including Flow) and Reaktive
* Interoperability with RxJava2 and RxJava3: conversion of sources between Reaktive and RxJava, ability to reuse RxJava's schedulers

### Kotlin Native pitfalls
Kotlin Native memory model and concurrency are very special. In general shared mutable state between threads is not allowed.
Since Reaktive supports multithreading in Kotlin Native, please read the following documents before using it:
* [Concurrency](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native/concurrency.html#object-transfer-and-freezing)
* [Immutability](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native/immutability.html)

Object detachment is relatively difficult to achieve and is very error-prone when the objects are created from outside and
are not fully managed by the library. This is why Reaktive prefers frozen state. Here are some hints:
* Any callback (and any captured objects) submitted to a Scheduler will be frozen
* `subscribeOn` freezes both its upstream source and downstream observer,
all the Disposables (upstream's and downstream's) are frozen as well,
all the values (including errors) are **not** frozen by the operator
* `observeOn` freezes only its downstream observer and all the values (including errors) passed through it, plus all the Disposables,
upstream source is **not** frozen by the operator
* Other operators that use scheduler (like `debounce`, `timer`, `delay`, etc.) behave same as `observeOn` in most of the cases

#### Thread local tricks to avoid freezing
Sometimes freezing is not acceptable, e.g. we might want to load some data in background and then update the UI.
Obviously UI can not be frozen. With Reaktive it is possible to achieve such a behaviour in two ways:

Use `threadLocal` operator:
```kotlin
val values = mutableListOf<Any>()
var isFinished = false

observable<Any> { emitter ->
    // Background job
}
    .subscribeOn(ioScheduler)
    .observeOn(mainScheduler)
    .threadLocal()
    .doOnBeforeNext { values += it } // Callback is not frozen, we can updated the mutable list
    .doOnBeforeFinally { isFinished = true } // Callback is not frozen, we can change the flag
    .subscribe()
```

Set `isThreadLocal` flag to `true` in `subscribe` operator:
```kotlin
val values = mutableListOf<Any>()
var isComplete = false

observable<Any> { emitter ->
    // Background job
}
    .subscribeOn(ioScheduler)
    .observeOn(mainScheduler)
    .subscribe(
        isThreadLocal = true,
        onNext = { values += it }, // Callback is not frozen, we can updated the mutable list
        onComplete = { isComplete = true } // Callback is not frozen, we can change the flag
    )
```

In both cases subscription (`subscribe` call) **must** be performed on the Main thread.

### Coroutines interop

This functionality is provided by the `coroutines-interop` module which is published in two versions:
- `coroutines-interop:<version>` is based on stable `kotlinx.coroutines`
- `coroutines-interop:<version>-nmtc` is based on [work-in-progress](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/pull/1648) multi-threaded `kotlinx.coroutines`

#### Coroutines interop based on stable kotlinx.coroutines

There are few important limitations:
- Neither `Job` nor `CoroutineContext` can be frozen (until release of the multi-threaded coroutines).
- Because of the first limitation all `xxxFromCoroutine {}` builders and `Flow.asObservable()` converter are executed inside `runBlocking` block in Kotlin/Native and should be subscribed on a background `Scheduler`.
- Ktor does not work well in multithreaded environment in Kotlin/Native (it may crash), so please don't mix Ktor and "stable" `coroutines-interop`.

Consider the following example for `corutines-interop`:
```kotlin
singleFromCoroutine {
    /*
     * This block will be executed inside `runBlocking` in Kotlin/Native.
     * Please avoid using Ktor here, it may crash.
     */
}
    .subscribeOn(ioScheduler)
    .observeOn(mainScheduler)
    .subscribe { /* Get the result here */ }
```

We recommend to avoid using Ktor in Kotlin/Native multithreaded environment until multithreaded coroutines, but if you really need consider the following function:
```kotlin
fun <T> singleFromCoroutineUnsafe(mainContext: CoroutineContext, block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> T): Single<T> =
    single { emitter ->
        GlobalScope
            .launch(mainContext) {
                try {
                    emitter.onSuccess(block())
                } catch (e: Throwable) {
                    emitter.onError(e)
                }
            }
            .asDisposable()
            .also(emitter::setDisposable)
    }
```

Now you can use this function together with Ktor but make sure you are doing this always on Main thread, neither `subscribeOn` nor `observeOn` nor any other thread switch are allowed.

#### Coroutines interop based on multi-threaded kotlinx.coroutines

The multi-threaded `kotlinx.coroutines` variant lifts some unpleasant restrictions: 
- Both `Job` and `CoroutineContext` can be frozen.

So there is one crucial difference:
- All `xxxFromCoroutine {}` builders and `Flow.asObservable()` converter are executed asynchronously in all targets (including Kotlin/Native), so can be subscribed on any scheduler.

Limitations:
- Because multi-threaded coroutines are work-in-progress, there are possible [issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/native-mt/kotlin-native-sharing.md#known-problems).
- Ktor can be used out of the box, but still can not be frozen, so main thread only.

##### Coroutines interop general limitations

Converters `Scheduler.asCoroutineDispatcher()` and `CoroutineContext.asScheduler()` are available only in JVM and JS currently.

### Subscription management with DisposableScope

Reaktive provides an easy way to manage subscriptions: [DisposableScope](https://github.com/badoo/Reaktive/blob/master/reaktive/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/badoo/reaktive/disposable/scope/DisposableScope.kt).

Take a look at the following examples:

```kotlin
val scope =
    disposableScope {
        observable.subscribeScoped(...) // Subscription will be disposed when the scope is disposed

        doOnDispose {
            // Will be called when the scope is disposed
        }

        someDisposable.scope() // `someDisposable` will be disposed when the scope is disposed
    }

// At some point later
scope.dispose()
```

```kotlin
class MyPresenter(
    private val view: MyView,
    private val longRunningAction: Completable
) : DisposableScope by DisposableScope() {

    init {
        doOnDispose {
            // Will be called when the presenter is disposed
        }
    }

    fun load() {
        view.showProgressBar()

        // Subscription will be disposed when the presenter is disposed
        longRunningAction.subscribeScoped(onComplete = view::hideProgressBar)
    }
}

class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity(), DisposableScope by DisposableScope() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        MyPresenter(...).scope()
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        dispose()

        super.onDestroy()
    }
}
```
